## Contributing
Welcome to my example Git Essentials repo! If you're here from the course, you have a few options:

1. Clone this repo to download all the code you see here (but you can't make changes and overwrite my code)
2. Fork this repo to add all this code to your GitHub profile _and then_ clone this repository from your account. Then you can make file changes and `git push` them to your forked version of this repo.
3. Open a GitHub issue! Feel free to open an issue and explore.
4. Once you've forked this repo and made some changes, you can open a pull request to merge your code into my repo here. Feel free to experiment with that until you feel confident opening a pull request.

If you decide to open a pull request and add some work to this repo, I ask that you keep it simple. You can add a new file or update this README.md file with your name in the contributors list at the bottom, but please don't make changes to the original files from the course.
